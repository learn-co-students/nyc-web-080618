## Deliverables

Here is a naive implementation of a bank account in Ruby using only a hash which stores key-value pairs.

```ruby
bank_account = {"user_id": 3, "balance": 100}
```

Write an implementation of a bank account that meets the following requirements:

* can print the balance of the account
* can deposit money into the account
* can withdraw money from the account
